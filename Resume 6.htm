                <p>
                    Throughout my career, I have demonstrated success in managing various complex ICT projects from
                    conceptualisation through to completion
                    including overseeing the entire budget management process to optimise revenue. I have successfully
                    led the implementation of various
                    business systems such as LIMS, DMS, ERP, HRIS, and championed the construction of IT architecture
                    for factories. My professional experience
                    expands to analysing the organisation’s operating environment to identify potential risks and
                    proactively implement risk management
                    procedures, including monitoring processes to ensure that all company activities comply with
                    policies, procedures, and statutory
                    regulations. I am a champion in providing inspired leadership to staff, including building and
                    maintaining mutually beneficial
                    relationships with key stakeholders that have the potential to add value to the organisation’s
                    success.
                    I am certified in all things AGILE with comprehensive experience working with an engineering teams

                    My core functions within the engineering team included ensuring business continuity while managing
                    redundancy,
                    access control/CCTV, server and control room requirements, the security of data and overall IT
                    operations.
                    I regard myself as a leader in overseeing all IT components for end-users inclusive of the planning,
                    execution and
